# SEPM-FRONTEND
Frontend prototype of a Library Management System developed for the Software Engineering and Project Management course. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the prototype model to demonstrate core library features.
This repository contains the frontend prototype for a Library Management System, developed as part of the Software Engineering and Project Management course.

The project follows a prototype model of software development, focusing on the design, usability, and interface of a digital library management platform. The prototype demonstrates how users (students, librarians, and administrators) can interact with the system to:

🔍 Search and browse books
📚 View availability status
📝 Issue and return books (simulated)
👤 Manage user accounts and login
📊 Track borrowed history

The purpose of this project is to apply software engineering principles (requirements gathering, prototyping, iterative refinement, and project management techniques) to a real-world domain.
